  Assembling the Y Gantry
---

Oh boy, we're flyin' now! It's time to get going on the Y gantry. This is what moves the toolhead forward and back, and also carries the X gantry as well. We've got a few sub-assemblies in this one, so let's dive in!

## X Idler Sub-Assembly

1. Insert the M3 Hex Nut into the slot for the hex nut on the back of the third and final belt tension arm.

2. Insert the M3x16mm Machine Screw through the front hole in the Belt Tension Arm and then tighten the M3x16mm Machine Screw.

3. Thread an M3 Cap Nut on the end of the M3x16mm machine screw.

4. Insert the GT2 idler pulley into the center slot of the belt tension arm.

5. Insert the M5x25mm machine screw through the top of the belt tension arm and the GT2 idler pulley.

6. Add an M5 Nyloc Hex Nut on the bottom of the Belt Tension Arm and tighten.

7. Insert the M5 Nyloc hex nut into the recess on the bottom of the X Idler Mount (FDM-0013).

8. Insert completed Belt Tension Arm assembly into slot.

9. Insert the M5x40mm machine screw through the hole in the top of the X idler mount so that it passes through the belt tension arm and tightens into the Nyloc Hex Nut.

## X Motor Mount Sub-Assembly

1. Install the GT2 pulley onto the motor shaft. The set screw side of the pulley should be nearest the motor. Tighten the set screws to lock the pulley into place. It should be at the tip of the shaft.

2. Place the motor onto the X motor mount (FDM-0006) with the wires exiting the motor on the left side of the bracket.

3. Insert a M3x8mm machine screw into each of the 4 holes in the bracket and tighten to secure the motor to the mount.

## Y Gantry Sub-Assemblies

1. Insert a M5 Hex Nut into each of the hex nut locations indicated below on a Y Gantry (FDM-0005).

2. Pull the hex nuts fully into location by screwing a M5x10mm machine screw into them from the opposite side of the Y gantry. Then unscrew the M5x10mm machine screw.

3. Insert a M3 Hex Nut vertically into the slot near the adjustment slot on the Y gantry.

4. Tighten an M3x16mm machine screw into the nut installed in the previous step. Don't tighten all the way, just screw it in until you can see the tip of the screw poking into the slot.

5. Insert an M3 nut vertically into the slot indicated below on a Y Gantry Support (FDM-0008).

6. Tighten an M3x16mm machine screw into the nut installed in the previous step. Don't tighten all the way, just screw it in until you can see the tip of the screw poking into the slot.

7. Insert a M5x40mm machine screw into the Y gantry through each of the two positions for the top rollers.

8. Place a V-Slot roller onto the two M5x40mm machine screws.

9. Insert M5 nuts into back side of Y gantry support and then place it onto the two M5x40mm machine screws. Screw them in so they're attached, but don't bother tightening them all the way; we'll need to loosen them in a later step.

10. Repeat steps 1-9 for the second Y gantry and Y gantry support.

## Final Assembly

1. Place a Y gantry assembly on each end of a v-slot extrusion. Don't worry about pushing it all the way into the print; there's extra space for adjustment.

2. Drop in and position a nut under the machine screw hole on the top of each gantry side and **loosely thread** a M5x10mm machine screw into each of the nuts. We do not want to tighten these yet; there is still adjusting to do.

3. Using four M5x25mm machine screws, attach the X idler assembly to the right side gantry body. Note that this part does have a polarity: the head of the machine screw that holds the idler should be visible when looking down at the top of the machine.

4. Using four M5x25mm machine screws, attach the X motor mount & gantry umbilical mount to the left side gantry assembly. The motor should be on top with the pulley facing downwards. The umbilical mount should be at the back, on the same side as the wires.

5. Finally, mount the X axis limit switch to the Y gantry. Secure it in place using two M3x8mm screws as shown in the image below. These screws tap directly into the print.
